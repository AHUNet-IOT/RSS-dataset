This is a receive signal strength dataset.

We constructed an urban network simulation environment using mininet-wifi and sumo.

We use the city road of Hefei, Anhui Province, China as a simulation map, as shown in the following figure.

In this map scenario, we have arranged 24 base stations, and the specific location map of the base stations is shown below.

We let 80 vehicles drive in the above map and collected the received signal strength of the vehicles under different base stations.

The collected source datasets are placed in the file "source dataset".

To facilitate the researchers' use, the source dataset was processed. The processed dataset is placed in the file "The processed dataset".

In addition, the map information and vehicle track information used for the experiments are placed in the file "Vehicle track".
